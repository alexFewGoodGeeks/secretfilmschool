            <p>However, when you donâ€™t have access to inside industry contacts or a big budget to promote your first indie, it can be a tough and lonely career path filled with disappointent.  Itâ€™s understandable to be overwhelmed and feel that it might be too much of a challenge. Weâ€™ve all been there.</p>
            <p>It shouldnâ€™t be so hard and all filmmakers deserve to have the same opportunity to fulfill their career ambitions regardless of where they live or who they know. If you have the talent and the passion then you deserve the same chances to succeed. The great news is thereâ€™s light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

            <p>By singlehandely taking his first indie feature film to global audiences, getting accepted into multiple film festivals and selling his title to an international film distribution company - with no prior knowledge or experience of how to do it - Secret Film School creator Simon Sharman achieved what over 90% of other first time filmmakers fail to do wirh their first film.</p>
            <p>Thatâ€™s why Secret Film School has been created, so that any filmmaker can achieve massive success with their independent film even if theyâ€™ve never done it before.</p>

            <p>3) Experience the fulfillment of becoming recognised in your field, becoming the successful filmmaker you know you can be and get paid to make the films you love to make.</p>
            <p>By enrolling in Secret Film School youâ€™re making sure that you donâ€™t become part of the 90% who fail with their first indie production and instead you set yourself on the path for the film career that you deserve. And by joining this program youâ€™ll save yourself from years of struggle, and countless thousands of dollars youâ€™d have otherwise lost.</p>
